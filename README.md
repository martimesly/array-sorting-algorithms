# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays.

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.


## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.


## Radix Sort

The algorithm avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix.

It is also implemented in C.
